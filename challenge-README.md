To run this project open a terminal in the server foler and run 'npm install' to reinstall nodemodules then 'npm run dev'. Then open another terminal in the client folder and run 'npm install' and then 'npm start'


With more time I would separate the components into a shopping component and a checkout component rather than having them both in the App.js file.

I started on the remove functionality but ran out of time so that is not fully implemented.
